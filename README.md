# Painter App User Guide

Welcome to our sketching app! This ReadMe file provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the various features available in the application.

## Undo Button
The "Undo" button allows you to undo the last drawn sketch of types such as "line," "circle," "shape in circle," and "flood fill." Please note that it doesn't work with other types like "bezier," "bSpline," "scan line," and sliders.

## Color Button
The "Color" button enables users to choose the color in which sketches will be drawn.

## Pixel Button
Clicking the "Pixel" button draws a pixel when the left mouse button is clicked and moved over the drawing area.

## Line Button
To draw a line, click the "Line" button, then click the left mouse button and drag it over the drawing area.

## Circle Button
The "Circle" button allows you to draw a circle. Click the left mouse button and drag it over the drawing area to create a circle.

## Flood Fill Button
To use the "Flood Fill" feature, click the left mouse button in the area you want to fill with the currently chosen color.

## Shape in Circle Button
Click the "Shape in Circle" button to draw a hexagon. Use the left mouse button and drag it over the drawing area to create the shape.

## Bezier Button
For the "Bezier" feature, click the left mouse button on the drawing area to create an action point (represented by a diamond). After creating at least 4 points, a bezier curve will be drawn. Move the points by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse. Remove points by right-clicking on them.

## BSpline Button
Similar to the "Bezier" feature, the "BSpline" button creates action points. After creating at least 4 points, a bSpline curve will be drawn. Move and remove points using the left and right mouse buttons, respectively.

## Scan Line Button
Click the "Scan Line" button on the drawing area to create action points (represented by diamonds). After creating at least 3 points, a shape will be created by right-clicking. These action points serve as vertices of the shape.

## Color Models
Manipulate the RGB color model by moving the first 3 sliders. The remaining 3 sliders allow you to manipulate the HVS color model.
